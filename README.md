# Learning a Small World Model in Minecraft for Real-World Robotic Navigation

## Overview

This project explores how a small-scale world model can be learned from a simulated 3D environment like Minecraft and then applied to a physical robot. Using Minecraft as a controllable simulation platform, this project aims to train a model to acquire spatial understanding from first-person visual input and action data. The learned world model is then deployed on a simple wheeled robot to evaluate simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) transfer.

The core idea is to study whether spatial reasoning and action affordances learned in a game environment can generalize to real-world settings, despite differences in scale, appearance, and noise.
